# Active Context: iCondo Compiler

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective
Enhance the `withBase` plugin for Vite configuration to include comprehensive, commonly-used Vite features and optimizations based on the official Vite guide and best practices.

### Immediate Task
The user requested to review and enhance the `with-base.ts` file for Vite configuration, ensuring it includes all common and popular features that developers typically need when setting up Vite projects.

## Recent Changes

### Completed Work
1. **Enhanced withBase Plugin**: Extended the `packages/vite-config/src/plugins/with-base.ts` with comprehensive Vite configuration including:
   - Advanced build optimization settings
   - CSS handling with modules and PostCSS
   - Development server configuration with HMR
   - Asset optimization and handling
   - Performance optimizations
   - esbuild configuration for TypeScript/JSX

2. **Version Conflict Resolution**: Previously resolved all version conflicts between packages:
   - Unified @types/node to ^24.3.0 across all packages
   - Unified Vite versions to 7.1.3
   - Eliminated TypeScript error suppressions

3. **Memory Bank Initialization**: Created comprehensive documentation structure:
   - Project brief with requirements and goals
   - Product context explaining user value
   - System patterns documenting architecture
   - Technical context covering technology stack

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test Enhanced Configuration**: Build and validate the enhanced `withBase` plugin
2. **Verify Type Safety**: Ensure all new configurations have proper TypeScript support
3. **Update Documentation**: Document new configuration options and their benefits
4. **Test Example Apps**: Verify enhanced configuration works in demo applications

### Pending Validation
- [ ] Build packages with enhanced withBase plugin
- [ ] Test vite-app with new configuration
- [ ] Verify TypeScript IntelliSense works properly
- [ ] Check for any performance regressions

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Configuration Scope
**Decision**: Include comprehensive but sensible defaults in `withBase` plugin
**Rationale**: Users expect base configuration to handle common scenarios
**Considerations**: Balance between completeness and simplicity

### Feature Coverage
**Included Features**:
- Build optimization (minification, chunking, assets)
- Development server (HMR, CORS, watch options)
- CSS handling (modules, PostCSS)
- Asset management (inlining limits, file naming)
- TypeScript/esbuild configuration
- Performance optimizations (dependency pre-bundling)

**Feature Decisions**:
- **CSS Modules**: Enabled with camelCase convention
- **Asset Inlining**: 4KB limit (Vite default)
- **Chunk Splitting**: Vendor chunks for React/React-DOM
- **Source Maps**: Development only by default
- **HMR**: Enabled with error overlay

### Type Safety Approach
**Strategy**: Maintain strict TypeScript compliance
**Implementation**: No @ts-expect-error suppressions in enhanced code
**Validation**: Ensure all options have proper interfaces

## Current Context State

### Project Status
- ✅ Core monorepo structure established
- ✅ All packages building successfully
- ✅ Version conflicts resolved
- ⏳ Enhanced withBase plugin implementation
- ⏳ Comprehensive testing pending

### Development Environment
- Working directory: `/Users/lehoangnhan/Documents/Personal/icondo-compiler`
- Active file: `packages/vite-config/src/plugins/with-base.ts`
- Build system: pnpm + Turbo + rslib
- TypeScript: Strict mode with full type safety

### Known Issues
1. Lint warnings in memory bank files (formatting)
2. Need to test enhanced configuration
3. Documentation needs updates for new features

### Success Criteria for Current Work
- [ ] Enhanced withBase plugin builds without errors
- [ ] All example apps work with enhanced configuration
- [ ] TypeScript provides proper IntelliSense for new options
- [ ] Performance remains optimal
- [ ] Documentation reflects new capabilities

## Recent Technical Context

### Last Session Summary
User was experiencing TypeScript IntelliSense issues where imported functions from `@stageit-labs/vite-config` weren't showing proper type suggestions. This was resolved by:
1. Unifying dependency versions across packages
2. Rebuilding all packages to generate fresh type definitions
3. Ensuring proper module resolution configuration

### Current Session
User requested enhancement of the base Vite configuration to include more comprehensive and commonly-used Vite features, referencing the official Vite guide for completeness while keeping things practical and popular.

## Working Approach

### Enhancement Strategy
1. **Research**: Analyzed Vite documentation for common configuration patterns
2. **Implementation**: Extended withBase plugin with comprehensive options
3. **Validation**: Will test builds and functionality
4. **Documentation**: Update memory bank and inline documentation

### Quality Assurance
- Maintain TypeScript strict compliance
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Test with real applications
- Validate performance impact
- Check IntelliSense functionality

The enhanced configuration aims to provide developers with a robust, production-ready base configuration that follows Vite best practices while maintaining the flexibility to customize for specific needs.
