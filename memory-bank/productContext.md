# Product Context: iCondo Compiler

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Modern web development involves multiple bundlers (Vite, Rspack, Rsbuild) each with their own configuration patterns. Developers working across different projects or migrating between bundlers face:

- **Configuration Fragmentation**: Different syntax and patterns for similar functionality
- **Knowledge Overhead**: Learning multiple bundler-specific APIs and patterns
- **Maintenance Burden**: Duplicated configuration logic across different bundler setups
- **Type Safety Gaps**: Inconsistent or missing TypeScript support across bundler configs
- **Migration Friction**: Difficulty moving projects between bundlers

### Market Context
The JavaScript ecosystem is rapidly evolving with new bundlers emerging to address performance and developer experience challenges. However, this creates fragmentation where teams must choose between bundler-specific optimizations and consistent development patterns.

## Problems This Project Solves

### For Developers
1. **Unified API**: Write configuration once, use across multiple bundlers
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript IntelliSense and compile-time validation
3. **Best Practices**: Built-in optimizations and sensible defaults
4. **Reduced Learning Curve**: Single API surface instead of multiple bundler APIs
5. **Easy Migration**: Switch bundlers without rewriting configuration

### For Teams
1. **Consistency**: Standardized patterns across all projects
2. **Maintainability**: Shared configuration logic and utilities
3. **Scalability**: Modular plugin system for custom extensions
4. **Quality**: Type-safe configurations reduce runtime errors
5. **Velocity**: Faster onboarding and development cycles

### For Organizations
1. **Standardization**: Enterprise-wide bundler configuration standards
2. **Risk Reduction**: Easier to migrate between bundlers as ecosystem evolves
3. **Developer Productivity**: Less time on configuration, more on features
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Transferable skills across projects

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals
1. **Simple Onboarding**: Install package, import plugins, configure in minutes
2. **Intuitive API**: Functions and options that match mental models
3. **Excellent Documentation**: Clear examples, API reference, migration guides
4. **Helpful Tooling**: IDE support, error messages, debugging utilities
5. **Predictable Behavior**: Consistent results across bundlers

### Core User Flows

#### Basic Setup Flow
```typescript
// User installs bundler-specific package
npm install @stageit-labs/vite-config

// User imports and configures
import { composePlugins, withBase, withReact } from '@stageit-labs/vite-config'

export default defineConfig(
  composePlugins(
    withBase({ mode: 'development' }),
    withReact({ refresh: true }),
    // custom config
    (config) => ({ ...config, /* custom options */ })
  )
)
```

#### Advanced Customization Flow
```typescript
// User can extend with custom plugins
const customPlugin = (options) => (config, context) => {
  // Access shared utilities and types
  return enhancedConfig
}

export default defineConfig(
  composePlugins(
    withBase(),
    withReact(),
    withSass(),
    customPlugin({ feature: true })
  )
)
```

#### Migration Flow
```typescript
// User switches from Vite to Rsbuild
// Old: import from '@stageit-labs/vite-config'
import { composePlugins, withBase, withReact } from '@stageit-labs/rsbuild-config'

// Same API, different bundler
export default defineConfig(
  composePlugins(
    withBase({ mode: 'development' }),
    withReact({ refresh: true })
  )
)
```

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: Number of projects using the system
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Feedback on ease of use and productivity
- **Type Safety**: Reduction in configuration-related runtime errors
- **Migration Success**: Teams successfully switching bundlers
- **Community Growth**: Contributions, plugins, and ecosystem adoption

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Frontend Developers**: Building modern web applications
- **Full-Stack Developers**: Working across multiple projects with different bundlers
- **Team Leads**: Establishing standards and patterns for their teams
- **DevOps Engineers**: Setting up build pipelines and configurations

### Secondary Users
- **Framework Authors**: Building on top of the configuration system
- **Plugin Developers**: Extending functionality for specific use cases
- **Enterprise Architects**: Establishing organization-wide standards

## Value Proposition
iCondo Compiler reduces configuration complexity while maintaining bundler-specific optimizations, enabling teams to focus on building features rather than managing build tools. It provides the consistency of a unified API with the performance benefits of modern bundlers.
