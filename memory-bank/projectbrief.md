# Project Brief: iCondo Compiler

## Project Overview
iCondo Compiler is a TypeScript monorepo project that provides a unified plugin-based configuration system for multiple JavaScript bundlers (Rsbuild, Rspack, and Vite). The project follows a modular architecture with shared utilities and bundler-specific implementations.

## Core Mission
Create a consistent, type-safe, and extensible configuration system that allows developers to write bundler-agnostic code while leveraging the specific optimizations and features of each bundler.

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Unified Plugin System**: Provide consistent plugin interface across Rsbuild, Rspack, and Vite
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions and IntelliSense
3. **Modular Architecture**: Separate packages for core utilities and bundler-specific implementations
4. **Extensibility**: Plugin-based system that allows easy addition of new features
5. **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling, documentation, and debugging support

### Technical Requirements
1. **Monorepo Structure**: Organized with pnpm workspaces and Turbo build system
2. **Package Namespace**: All packages under `@stageit-labs/*` namespace
3. **Build System**: Uses rslib for package compilation with TypeScript declarations
4. **Version Consistency**: Unified dependency versions across all packages
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing strategy for all bundler configurations

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Fast build times and minimal bundle overhead
2. **Reliability**: Consistent behavior across different bundlers
3. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented, and testable code
4. **Compatibility**: Support for modern JavaScript/TypeScript features

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All bundler configurations (Rsbuild, Rspack, Vite) work with unified plugin system
- [ ] Full TypeScript IntelliSense support in all IDEs
- [ ] Zero version conflicts between packages
- [ ] Clean build process with proper type generation
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation and examples
- [ ] Easy onboarding for new developers

## Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing bundler ecosystems
- Should not introduce breaking changes to bundler-specific configurations
- Must follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
- Limited to modern Node.js versions (18+)

## Timeline
This is an ongoing architectural project focused on establishing solid foundations for scalable bundler configuration management.
